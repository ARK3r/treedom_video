Since the page says for every 1000 views they will plant a tree, this script will put the webpage on a pc on the loop to add one view every 10 seconds (ish), SO SOME TREES GET PLANTED.

## requirements
you need to install "pynput"
it is present on pynput

## How to
1. load the page on your browser on a pc:
  https://www.instagram.com/p/BwUkFO2nmTn/
2. run the python script:
  ```
  python3 main.py
  python main.py
  ```
3. click on the webpage open on your browser
4. let it run until you need to start using your pc or you're done being a great person planting trees at no cost, then click on the terminal or the python executable and press "Ctrl+C" and end the execution.
